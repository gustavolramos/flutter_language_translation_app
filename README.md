# riverpod_language_translate

This Flutter project utilizes the Google Translate API and Riverpod to create a Google Translate clone for portfolio reasons only.

## What did I use in this project?

- State Management with "riverpod" package
- Responsive Layouts with the "responsive_builder" package
- Text themes with the "google_fonts" package
- Futures, API Requests, JSON parsing, etc with the "http" package
- Widget composition, callbacks, etc
- RapidApi's "Text Translator" API by "Devisty"

## For context

Since I moved to Italy, I started using Google Translate and alike apps a lot, so I decided to attempt my own version of one.

While not a challenging app in itself, it uses a lot of important concepts at once, hence why I thought it was a good idea.
